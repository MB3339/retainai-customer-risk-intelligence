# RetainAI – AI-Powered Customer Risk & Retention Intelligence
RetainAI is an end-to-end AI decision-support system that predicts customer disengagement risk and translates machine learning outputs into actionable business strategies using generative AI.

This project combines machine learning and Google Opal to bridge the gap between technical model results and real-world business decision-making.

🚀 Project Overview

Businesses often struggle to understand and act on churn or customer risk predictions. RetainAI solves this by:

Predicting customer disengagement risk using a machine learning model

Identifying key risk and loyalty drivers

Automatically generating business-friendly insights

Recommending customer engagement strategies

The system is designed to be industry-neutral and can be applied to telecom, SaaS, retail, banking, and subscription-based services.

🧠 Machine Learning Model

The predictive model was built using Python and Scikit-learn.

Model Details

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Task: Binary classification (Customer at Risk vs Loyal)

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision & Recall

ROC-AUC Score

Confusion Matrix

Feature Importance used to identify:

Customer Risk Drivers

Customer Loyalty Drivers

🤖 AI Application Layer (Google Opal)

Google Opal was used to build an AI-powered application that:

Accepts model performance metrics and feature importance

Explains model results in plain language

Identifies business-relevant risk and loyalty factors

Generates actionable customer retention strategies

Produces executive-level summaries

This transforms raw ML outputs into decision-ready insights.

📊 Example Insights Generated

Risk Drivers

Customers using Fiber Optic services show higher disengagement risk

Streaming service users are more likely to leave

Paperless billing and multiple service lines correlate with higher churn

Loyalty Drivers

Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn risk

Customers with Online Security and Tech Support services are more loyal

AI-Recommended Strategies

Encourage long-term contracts through incentives

Bundle support and security services

Proactively engage high-risk customers
